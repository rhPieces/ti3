## ti3 - rhPieces
This is an electronic clone of the ti3 boardgame. Some friends and I purchased ti3
and enjoyed several games. We quickly came to the conclusion that a full ti3 game is
quite the commitment. This is an attempt to lower the time commitment by providing
internet connectivity and game saving, so we don't all have to be at the same place
at the same time for a whole day. As you can see it's very very early in development.

### Requirements
Currently, ti3 depends on python, pygame and json.
